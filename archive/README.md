# Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from ClawStarter's development process.

**Why archived?** These files were reviewed by 3 PRISM cycles (9 specialist reviewers) on 2026-02-15 and determined to be:
- Superseded by current implementation
- One-time review/audit artifacts
- Historical research that informed decisions already made
- Old script versions replaced by `openclaw-autosetup.sh`

**Nothing is lost.** All content is preserved here and in git history.
