## What's Missing (Known Gaps)

1. **Video content** — Landing page has placeholder, needs Jeremy's video
2. **Real download link** — Button needs to point to actual .zip
3. **End-to-end testing** — Script should be tested on clean Mac
4. **README update** — Should mention new quickstart option

## Ready for Jeremy?

**YES** ✅

The Launchpad package is complete and ready for review. The landing page is beautiful, the quickstart reduces setup friction dramatically, and the skills pack gives immediate value.
