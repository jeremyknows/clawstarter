# ClawStarter — 3-Step Quickstart

**From zero to running AI bot in 15 minutes.**

---

## Before You Start

✅ **You need:**
- A Mac (any model, macOS 12+)
- $5-10 for AI credits ([OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys))
- 15 minutes

✅ **You'll have:**
- Running AI bot (web dashboard)
- Auto-starts on reboot
- Ready to chat

---

## Step 1: Get Your API Key

1. Go to **[openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)**
2. Sign up (email or Google)
3. Add $5-10 in credits
4. Create an API key
5. **Copy it** (starts with `sk-or-v1-...`)

💡 **Alternative:** Use Anthropic ([console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)) if you prefer Claude directly.

## Step 2: Run the Setup

Open **companion.html** in your browser and follow the 10-step wizard.

**Or, use the one-command installer:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeremyknows/clawstarter/main/openclaw-autosetup.sh | bash
```

The script will:
- Install dependencies (Homebrew, Node.js, OpenClaw)
- Ask for your API key
- Set up the bot
- Start the gateway

**Time:** 10-15 minutes (longer if installing Homebrew for the first time)

---

## Step 3: Start Chatting

When you see:
```
✅ Setup complete!
Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:18789
Gateway token: [long random string]
```

1. **Save the gateway token** somewhere safe
2. Open **http://127.0.0.1:18789** in your browser
3. Paste your gateway token
4. Send a message: `Hello! What can you help me with?`

**Done!** Your bot is running.
